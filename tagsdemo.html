    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language on Web to develop web pages.
        HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML specification which was
        published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01
        version is widely used but currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this
        version was published in 2012.</p>
    <p>Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs,
        lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers. Now, HTML is being
        widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available in HTML language.

    <p> HTML is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they
        are working in Web Development Domain.</p>
